        <h2>About Electrobiotechlab</h2>
        <p>Our lab conducts cutting-edge research in electrobiotechnology, focusing on sustainable solutions for environmental challenges across biotechnological, agricultural, and environmental sectors. We aim to create impactful and practical advancements through innovative research and applications.</p>
        <p>Explore the sections above to learn more about our ongoing research projects, meet our talented team, access our publications, and connect with us.</p>
        <p>Our primary focus lies in harnessing electroactive microbes to address critical environmental problems. This includes bioelectrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), with a special emphasis on microbes like cable bacteria.</p>
        <p>Cable bacteria are particularly fascinating due to their ability to conduct electricity over long distances, offering promising applications in carbon capture, pollution mitigation, and water quality improvement. By studying these unique properties, we aim to develop innovative strategies for remediating ecosystems and recovering valuable resources.</p>
        <p>Our work is enriched through partnerships with indigenous communities, where we integrate cultural heritage into scientific research. </p>
        <p>Through these efforts, we strive to contribute to global sustainability by advancing technologies that harmonize with natural processes, fostering a future that aligns with ecological balance and innovation.</p>
