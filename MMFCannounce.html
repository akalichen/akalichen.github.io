        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine powering vital ocean-monitoring sensors, not with bulky batteries or lengthy cables, but with nature’s own tiny powerhouses, microorganisms. James Madison University's Assistant Professor Cheng Li and his team are developing a cutting-edge marine microbial fuel cell (MFC) that transforms ocean biomass into renewable electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supported by a $7.8 million DARPA grant led by the University of Maryland (UMD), this collaborative project involves research heavyweights like Battelle, George Washington University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University. Together, they aim to create a sustainable, ocean-friendly power source that can run fully submerged and self-refuel, delivering battery-level energy over extended periods.

        <h2>JMU's Role in the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Professor Cheng Li, renowned for his pioneering work on microbial fuel cells at Oregon State University, is leading JMU’s efforts in this ambitious initiative. His primary focus is designing a stackable MFC array capable of generating 10 watts of steady power for a year—an unprecedented milestone in the field of bioelectrochemistry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next 18 months, Professor Li plans to involve at least six JMU students in building and testing this innovative technology. The system will harvest ocean biomass for on-site fermentation and power generation, with other project partners handling biomass collection and processing.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a marine microbial fuel cell that can self-refuel and operate fully submerged.</li>
            <li>Generate a steady output of 10 watts of power for a year or longer.</li>
            <li>Provide a sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to traditional power sources for ocean sensors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            “Ten watts may not sound like much compared to what a coal-fired or nuclear power plant produces,” said Professor Li, “but it’s a huge leap for microorganisms and the MFC.”

        <h2>Impact and Vision</h2>
        <p>
            From the heart of JMU to the depths of the ocean, this project represents a leap forward in renewable energy technology. By transforming ocean biomass into electricity, the team is paving the way for autonomous, clean, and eco-friendly marine technology that could revolutionize how we power ocean sensors.
        </p>
        <p>
            This innovation not only addresses critical defense needs but also aligns with broader goals of environmental sustainability and technological advancement.
